<p>You have a limited number of attempts to find the secret combination. Each attempt must be composed of the available colors, and may contain the same color several times.<br />The number of attempts and colors available depends on the chosen diffilculty.</p>
<p>A location in an attempted combination can correspond to only one indicator (red, white or nothing). The order of the indicators obtained is random and therefore provides no additional information.</p>
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>Secret combination: yellow, green, red and blue<br />Combination attempted: green, magenta, white and blue<br />Indicators obtained: 1 red and 1 white</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue gets a red indicator, because it's well-placed</li>
<li>Green gets a white indicator because it is present but poorly placed</li>
<li>Magenta and white get nothing, as they are not present in the secret combination
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Secret combination: yellow, green, blue and blue<br />Tried combination: green, green, white and blue<br />Indicators obtained: 2 reds</p>
<p>Explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The second green and the blue get a red indicator each because they are well-placed.</li>
<li>The first green gets nothing, because the one in the secret combination gives a red.</li>
<li>White gets nothing, as it is not present in the secret combination.</li>
</ul>
